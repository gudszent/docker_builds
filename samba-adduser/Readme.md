# Samba

A [Docker](http://docker.com) file to build images for many platforms (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6) with a installation of [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) that is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. This is my own Multi-architecture docker recipe.

> Be aware! You should read carefully the usage documentation of every tool!
